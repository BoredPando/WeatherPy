### Analysis

+ As expected, weather becomes warmer closer to the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This is most likely due to the tilt of the earth and opposing seasonality trends by hemisphere.
+ There is a weak relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, there are strong bands of cities at 0, 20, 40, 75, and 90% cloudiness.
+ There is a weak relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, the farther from the equator, the more likely a city is to have wind speeds over 20 mph.
